    <p>Strawberry Jam. Yummy and easy. Ish.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1kg hulled strawberry</li>
        <li>750g jam sugar</li>
        <li>Juice 1 lemon</li>
        <li>Small knob of butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the strawberries by wiping them with a 
            piece of damp kitchen paper. (Wiping the 
            strawberries rather than washing them ensures 
            the fruit doesn’t absorb lots of water – too 
            much water and the jam won’t set easily.) To 
            hull the fruit, use a knife to cut a cone shape 
            into the strawberry and remove the stem. Cut any 
            large berries in half.</li>
        <li>Put the strawberries in a bowl and gently toss 
            through the sugar. Leave uncovered at room 
            temperature for 12 hrs or overnight. This process 
            helps the sugar to dissolve, ensures the fruit 
            doesn’t disintegrate too much and helps to keep 
            its vibrant colour.</li>
        <li>Before starting the jam, put 2 saucers in the 
            freezer. Tip the strawberry mixture into a 
            preserving pan with the lemon juice. Set over a 
            low heat and cook very gently. If any sugar 
            remains on the sides of the pan, dip a pastry 
            brush in hot water and brush the sugar away.</li>
        <li>When you can no longer feel any grains of sugar 
            remaining, turn up the heat to start bubbling the 
            jam and bringing it to the boil. (The sugar must 
            be completely dissolved before increasing the 
            heat, otherwise it will be difficult for the jam 
            to set, and it may contain crystallised lumps of 
            sugar.)</li>
        <li>Boil hard for 5-10 mins until the jam has reached 
            105C on a preserving or digital thermometer, then 
            turn off the heat. If you don’t have a 
            thermometer, spoon a little jam onto one of the 
            cold saucers. Leave for 30 secs, then push with 
            your finger; if the jam wrinkles and doesn’t 
            flood to fill the gap, it is ready. If not, turn 
            the heat back on and boil for 2 mins more, then 
            turn off the heat and do the wrinkle test again. 
            Repeat until ready.</li>
        <li>Use a spoon to skim any scum that has risen to 
            the surface and discard this. Do this only once 
            at the end, rather than constantly during the 
            boiling stage, to reduce wastage.</li>
        <li>Add a knob of butter, if you like, to the finished 
            jam, and stir in to melt. This will help to 
            dissolve any remaining scum that you haven’t 
            managed to spoon off the top. Leave the jam to 
            settle for 15 mins – this will ensure that the 
            fruit stays suspended in the mixture and doesn’t 
            all float to the top of the jam jar. Meanwhile, 
            sterilise your jars.</li>
        <li>Ladle into warm jars, filling to just below the 
            rim. Place a wax disc on top of the jam (this 
            prevents mildew forming), then cover with a lid 
            or a cellophane circle and elastic band. Pop on a 
            label (include the date), plus a pretty fabric 
            top, if you like. The jam can be stored for up to 
            1 year in a cool, dry place. Refrigerate after 
            opening.</li>
