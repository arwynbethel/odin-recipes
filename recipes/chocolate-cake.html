    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5. Butter the 
            base and sides of two 20cm round sandwich tins 
            and line the bases with baking parchment.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, beat together 200g golden 
            caster sugar, 200g softened unsalted butter, 4 
            large eggs, 200g self-raising flour, 2 tbsp 
            cocoa powder, 1 tsp baking powder, ½ tsp vanilla 
            extract, 2 tbsp milk and a pinch of salt until 
            pale.</li>
        <li>Divide the mixture between the prepared tins. 
            Bake for 20 mins or until a skewer inserted into 
            the centre of the cake comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Leave to cool in the tin for 10 mins, then turn 
            out onto a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li>For the buttercream, put 100g chopped milk 
            chocolate in a heatproof bowl and melt in the 
            microwave, stirring every 30 secs. Leave the 
            melted chocolate to cool for 5 mins.</li>
        <li>Mash 200g softened butter and 400g icing sugar 
            together with a fork, then switch to a wooden 
            spoon or electric beaters, if you have them.</li>
        <li>Sift in 5 tbsp cocoa powder with a pinch of salt 
            and pour in the melted chocolate and 2 tbsp milk. 
            Mix again until smooth.</li>
        <li>On a cake stand or large plate, sandwich the cakes 
            together with half of the buttercream, then spread 
            the rest on top. Decorate with chocolate shards, 
            if you like.</li>
